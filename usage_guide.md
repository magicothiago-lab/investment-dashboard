## 🎓 Understanding Metrics

### ROI (Return on Investment)
```
ROI = (Received - Invested) / Invested × 100
```
Example: Invested €1000, Received €1100
ROI = (1100 - 1000) / 1000 × 100 = 10%

### Yield
```
Yield = Received / Invested × 100
```
Example: Invested €1000, Received €100
Yield = 100 / 1000 × 100 = 10%

### Profit/Loss
```
P&L = Received - Invested
```
Example: Invested €1000, Received €1100
P&L = €100 (profit)
